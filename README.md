### The run down...
One of the first GSAP projects that I ever did... And it certainly shows. Although I try not to touch up these little demos once I've finished them, I couldnt help but make a few necessary alterations to the timing of the animation and masking the canvas. I put this together rather sloppily, it amazes me that it turned out like it did. This was also before I learned to ween myself off jQuery. 

### Some things I'm particularly proud of...
This project was not a complete disaster dispite admittedly being a very overly ambitiious undertaking at the time.

### Some things that kinda suck...
The code quality and structure definitely leaves something to be desired. I would later on adopt Typescript for these demos which helped clean things up quite a bit in my opinion.
